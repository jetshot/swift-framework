# swift-framework
a clean reusable easy to use framework
How to use:
1. copy paste the module folder or component you want to reuse.
2. find and replace from project work space the module name, example: MyModuleNameViewController, so just find and replace MyModuleName to reuse another module/component of  your choice.
3. Then you just need to focus on that module folder and do all your additional setup and configuration on that folder only, If you're moving from one folder to another then somethings not right.
4. Hope this helps :)


Aim:
1. Always use Best Practices.
2. Something Clean, Simple and Easy to use, 
3. Performace Efficient & Scalable
3. One time project theme setup.
4. By Using only table views, we eliminate the problems on
- inconsistent object placements
- cluttered constraints
- jumping from one file to another
- spaghetti code
- consistently creating scrollviews on view controllers
- dynamic content sizes
- storyboard problems
- rmultiple repeated views or components that are hard to maintain
5. Follows SOLID Swift Principles
6. Have a collection of useful and important extensions and frameworks ready.
7. MVVM Style
9. RestApiManager
10. And more, aslong as it does not complicate the use of the framework


Naming Convention Rules:
- Camel case on methods and variables
- Capitalized on Constants
- Base Names on modules not by Components
- Group everything on per module basis with all base components in it.
- Unique Module name, for easy find and replace on module names when reusing.
- Try use default provided suffixes by apple on cocoa files
- Name by task not by purpose.
